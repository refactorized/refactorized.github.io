publications.  Specifically I worked on new and improved features for Vogue
Magazine's version of the viewer which required a more faceted search to
expose rich metadata on the styles, topics, and artists tied to nearly every
photograph and graphic in the publication.</p>
<p>My most valuable contribution was a re-architecture of that search
functionality, unifying various code paths that had accumulated through the
maturation of the product focused javascript module. I employed disciplined
approach to organizing code which eliminated duplication of effort,
decoupled concerns, and established a single point of truth for searches and
results.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="http://amplifyjs.com/api/pubsub/">amplify.js core pub/sub</a>
functionality, I restricted interaction with the search core to a simple
publish and subscribe interface.  This way searches initiated from disparate
user interactions provided by the application all followed the same work
flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>The search is 'published' as an event the search service is subscribed
to. 2. The search service proceeds, to validate, correct, and execute the
search asynchronously with the 3rd party search provider. 3. Upon completion (
or error ) of the search, the service would publish a search results message</li>
<li>Downstream (subscribed) components would respond to the new search
results as needed, and based on various states which were outside the
concern of the main search module.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result was a more reliable search core, in which bugs and features could
be reasoned about in isolation, and fixed/implemented in one code location.</p>
<p>This was during a time where frameworks like Angular were still gaining
traction, and redux was far from a buzzword in the front end development
community.  I am proud that my solution to this problem shares many things
in common with modern day approaches relied upon by thousands of developers.</p>

the team that handled online reservations through the main website. I
prototyped and implemented improvements to the hotel listing and
details steps of the reservations workflow.</p>
<p>Each change we made was based on extensive user research and the
expertise of our UX department, then tested in the wild using A/B and
multivariate strategies.  I would work very closely with the UX team,
often in real time, to get the designs pixel-perfect to their vision.</p>
<p>In order to to alleviate some dev-ops issues which were hindering
development speed, I set up tooling to inject the variations we were
developing directly into the page via a javascript bookmarklet.  This
code was reused as part of the live, production testing whereby it
interacted with our vendor CRO system.</p>
<p>This work required a broad skill-set and the ability to communicate
well between various technical disciplines.  I find such challenges
rewarding, and well suited to my strengths.</p>
</div><div class="leader"><h2>Blog &amp; Site</h2><p><a href="refactorized.github.io">refactorized.github.io</a> is in-part my laboratory and
playground.  Here I can try out new or fun ideas and keep my
skills sharp.  It is also a work in progress, so things like
navigation are not always production ready, but I believe in getting
good code out the door, and making it better as time affords.</p>
<p>The site consists of simple static assets which are assembled by a
gulp workflow, and hosted on github. The source lives in a <a href="https://github.com/refactorized/refactorized.github.io">GitHub
repository</a>
where the code for the following highlights can be examined.</p>
</div><div class="project"><h3>The header</h3><p>A fun, if slightly excessive, animated header for the blog page, which
utilizes css shadows and transitions to create an effect inspired by
the title screens of old video games.</p>
<p>Originally prototyped in <a href="http://codepen.io/refactorized/pen/yJqogw">this code
pen</a>, the code has matured
to use css transitions in between less-frequent DOM updates
allowing the browser to optimize redraws.</p>
<p>The vertical positioning of the shadows is modulated by a simple sine
function, while the horizontal component is driven by the mouse position.</p>
</div><div class="project"><h3>Custom Integration of Zurb Foundation</h3><p>The site uses <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation 6</a> as a
base but modifies some aspects such as headers heavily.  It may have
been easier to code the styling from scratch, but I wanted to explore
strategies for integrating customizations atop the extensive
framework.</p>
<p>By using foundation's SASS files I was able to inject customizations
and overrides without having to fork the repo.  Owing to the flexibility of
the gulp build process, I am able to retain bower as the asset
manager.</p>
<p>I think this approach has made significant progress towards my goal of
combining modern, rapid site development strategies with deeper
customizations that can set sites apart from their archetypical peers.</p>
</div><div class="project"><h3>Gulp</h3><p>I utilize gulp to build a static site from several asset types
including markdown posts, pug templates, and SASS processed style sheets.</p>
<p>Gulp's simple approach to manipulation of resources via chained
transform stream appeals to my preference for functional paradigms.
The abstraction works well enough for common tasks like template
expansion but really shines with more complex scenarios. because
gulpfiles are code, not configuration, simple transforms can be
composed into specialized tasks in a very straightforward manner.</p>
<p>One such task allows me to keep post assets in the same directory as
the md file, but ensures they will be copied to the appropriate asset
location during the build.  This, in turn, allows me to use whatever
markdown editor I prefer without worrying about the eventual location
of the published posts and assets.</p>
<p>Another similar task normalizes urls for scripts and images based on
a configured root path.  My implementation composes some common path
logic with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cheerio">gulp-cheerio</a>
which enables jQuery-like DOM transforms, sparing me from
alternatives like complicated regex replacement.</p>
<p>As I expand the site to include new functionalities, I continue to
update the gulpfile accordingly.  There's a lot of room for growth
and polish, but I find maintenance mostly easy and enjoyable.</p>

intertwined functionality into simple isolated concerns that minimize
branching logic.</p>

project designed to teach several concepts in JavaScript.  Including:</p>
<ul>
<li>canvas 2D</li>
<li>simple particle systems</li>
<li>collections</li>
<li>vector math</li>
<li>mouse interaction</li>
<li>modeling velocity and acceleration in time intervals</li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite feature of this demonstration is the options object at the very
beginning of the code. This invites experimentation by collecting the
critical values of the simulation into one chunk of code which can be
understood and altered by programmers of any level.  A huge variety of
behavior can be realized by playing with these values alone, but further
insight awaits the curious programmer who would explore the implementation.</p>

difficult to explain succinctly.  This codepen illustrates the process of
drawing fluid curves which are governed only by a series of related straight
line segments.  Like the swarm example, it seeks to invite experimentation and
interaction - though the code could use a little restructuring to increase
accessibility.</p>
