<p><em>I&apos;m still working on it, as you can likely tell.</em></p>
<p>Instead of wrangling some existing solution I am rolling my own simple static site-gen with gulp.</p>
<p>This allows me to host the output for free using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>!</p>
<p>Repo is on <a href="https://github.com/refactorized/rf-site">github</a> and uses the <a href="https://github.com/shinnn/gulp-gh-pages">gulp-gh-pages plugin</a> to deploy the actual site.</p>
<p>Code is an unholy mess at the moment, but after a refactor it should be a pretty good guide for similar projects.</p>
<p>I am vacillating between keeping the code very direct to the purpose of generating this particular blog or delving into creating a general purpose engine.  </p>
<p>Either way, my plan is to clean the code up and write several posts on its continued development.</p>
<p>Things to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>comments</li>
<li>general layout and navigation improvements</li>
<li>archives</li>
<li>tags</li>
</ul>

<p>A polyfill is a shim that makes browsers work like they should have in the
first place.</p>

<p>This is a feature I expected to find in nvm, and when I didn&apos;t I forked the repo so I could add it. I am a little busy right now, however; and I didn&apos;t know the best way to go about writing tests for a proper pull request, seeing as I would have to monitor the launch of a web page.</p>
<p>So I took the path of least resistance, and kind of like how that turned out. There is something delicious about adding so much convenience with 5 minutes of thought and one line of code.
